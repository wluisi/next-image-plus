## Introduction

This guide will show you how to use the HTML `<picture>` element with a Next.js app. It will also go into detail on how to optimize performance, using advanced preloading techniques.

The <Link href="https://web.dev/learn/design/picture-element">HTML picture element</Link> allows developers to display different images for different devices or screen sizes. It enables **art direction**, where you serve entirely different images depending on the context, not just resized versions of the same image.

This is especially useful when different crops or compositions are better suited to different screen sizes — for example, a wide landscape on desktop and a centered square on mobile.

```html
<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 1024px)" srcset="/images/hero-desktop.jpg" />
  <source media="(min-width: 431px)" srcset="/images/hero-tablet.jpg" />
  <img src="/images/hero-mobile.jpg" alt="Scenic view of mountains and river" />
</picture>
```

## Next.js Image Component

The built-in Next.js <Link href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image">Image component </Link> doesn't support the `<picture>` element. It's optimized for responsive image sizing via `srcSet` and `sizes`, but it doesn't allow for art direction — you can't define separate images for different breakpoints or aspect ratios.

With the release of <Link href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-14-1">v14.1.0</Link>, Next.js added a new function called <Link href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#getimageprops">getImageProps( )</Link>
This function exposes some of the under the hood Image API and allows you to get props to pass to an HTML `<img>` element.

While this can be used to generate the markup needed to support `<picture>`, preloading of images is not supported.
The typical way to do this with the Image component or `getImageProps()` with a `<img>` element, is setting `priority` to `true`.

```tsx
import { getImageProps } from "next/image";

const { props: desktopProps, ...desktopPropsRest } = getImageProps({
  width: 1440,
  height: 875,
  quality: 80,
  src: "https://picsum.photos/id/502/1440/875",
  // Has no effect, and does not add preload links to `<head>`.
  priority: true,
});

<picture>
  <source
    media="(min-width: 1000px)"
    {...desktopPropsRest}
    srcSet={desktopProps.srcSet}
  />
</picture>;
```

However, this has no effect when using `getImageProps()` with the HTML `<source>` element, and does not add `<link rel="preload" as="image">` tag to the document's `<head>`. It seems
under the hood of the Next.js Image API, `priority` prop _only triggers adding preload links to the `<head>` if it's used in conjunction with the `<img>` element_.

This can present a performance hurdle if you are using responsive images above the fold, and they are flagged as the <Link href="https://web.dev/articles/lcp#what-elements-are-considered">Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</Link>

## Next Image Plus

**next-image-plus** is a set of primitive React components, built on top of the <Link href="https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image">Next.js Image API</Link> and <Link href="https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19">React 19</Link>, which adds full support for picture and background images, including preloading any `<picture>` elements flagged as the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).

### Install the package

First we need to install <Link href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-image-plus">next-image-plus</Link> package from npm:

```shell
npm install next-image-plus
```

### Using the Picture, Source, and Img components

**next-image-plus** provides 3 components for creating responsive images with art direction:

- `<Picture />` component provides a wrapper for zero or more Source components and one Img component.
- `<Source />` component specifies an image and a media query.
- `<Img />` component provides a fallback image

To set up the `<Picture />` component, we'll need to import the following inside our Next.js component:

```tsx
import { Picture, Source, Img } from "next-image-plus";
```

The HTML `<picture>` element allows for multiple source images, for our demo here, we're going to use 3 different sized images: medium, large, and a fallback.

This table maps out our different breakpoints, images, and media queries we'll use:

| Breakpoint | Image                               | Media                                      | Width | Height |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----- | ------ |
| medium     | https://picsum.photos/id/59/860/430 | (min-width: 430px) and (max-width: 1024px) | 860px | 430px  |
| large      | https://picsum.photos/id/59/220/220 | (min-width: 1024px)                        | 220px | 220px  |
| fallback   | https://picsum.photos/id/59/430/215 | (max-width: 430px)                         | 430px | 215px  |

Using the components, we can create a `picture` element with 2 sources and a fallback image.

```tsx
<Picture>
  {/* Medium breakpoint */}
  <Source
    media="(min-width: 430px) and (max-width: 1024px)"
    src="https://picsum.photos/id/59/860/430"
    width={860}
    height={430}
  />
  {/* Large breakpoint */}
  <Source
    media="(min-width: 1024px)"
    src="https://picsum.photos/id/59/220/220"
    width={220}
    height={220}
  />
  {/* Fallback */}
  <Img
    src="https://picsum.photos/id/59/430/215"
    width={430}
    height={215}
    alt="Mountains and a river"
  />
</Picture>
```

In the browser, this will render the following HTML:

```html
<picture>
  <source
    media="(min-width: 431px) and (max-width: 1023px)"
    width="860"
    height="430"
    srcset="
      /_next/image?url=https://picsum.photos/id/59/860/430&w=860&q=75  1x,
      /_next/image?url=https://picsum.photos/id/59/860/430&w=1920&q=75 2x
    "
  />
  <source
    media="(min-width: 1024px)"
    width="220"
    height="220"
    srcset="
      /_next/image?url=https://picsum.photos/id/59/220/220&w=256&q=75 1x,
      /_next/image?url=https://picsum.photos/id/59/220/220&w=640&q=75 2x
    "
  />
  <img
    src="/_next/image?url=https://picsum.photos/id/59/430/215&w=860&q=75"
    width="430"
    height="215"
    alt="Mountains and a river"
  />
</picture>
```

<Callout type="info">
A key difference between the native html element for `<source>` and the `<Source>` component, is the html element does not accept a `src` attribute, but uses `srcset` instead.

The value for `srcset` will get automatically generated for you, using the Next.js Image API, based on the `src` prop value.

</Callout>

### Preloading for LCP

If your image is flagged as the <Link href="https://web.dev/articles/lcp#what-elements-are-considered">Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</Link>, preloading can speed up performance and improve your <Link href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/core-web-vitals">Core Web Vitals</Link> score.
The `<Picture />` component has built-in support for preloading images via the preload prop:

```tsx
<Picture preload={true}>
```

When `preload` is set to true, the component will add a `<link rel="preload" as="image">` tag to the document's `<head>`. In the browser, this will render the following HTML:

```html
<head>
  <link
    rel="preload"
    as="image"
    fetchpriority="high"
    imagesrcset="/_next/image?url=https://picsum.photos/id/59/430/215&w=430&q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https://picsum.photos/id/59/430/215&w=860&q=75 2x"
    media="(max-width: 430px)"
  />
  <link
    rel="preload"
    as="image"
    fetchpriority="high"
    imagesrcset="/_next/image?url=https://picsum.photos/id/59/860/430&w=860&q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https://picsum.photos/id/59/860/430&w=1920&q=75 2x"
    media="(min-width: 431px) and (max-width: 1023px)"
  />
  <link
    rel="preload"
    as="image"
    fetchpriority="high"
    imagesrcset="/_next/image?url=https://picsum.photos/id/59/220/220&w=256&q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https://picsum.photos/id/59/220/220&w=640&q=75 2x"
    media="(min-width: 1024px)"
  />
</head>
```

This tells the browser what images are critical resources, and which should be fetched as soon as possible. You can read more about preloading responsive images <Link href="https://web.dev/articles/preload-responsive-images#preload">here</Link>
