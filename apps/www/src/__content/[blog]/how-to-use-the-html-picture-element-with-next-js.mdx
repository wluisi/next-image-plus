## Introduction

This guide will show you how to use the HTML `<picture>` element with a Next.js app.

## HTML picture element

The HTML `<picture>` element allows developers to display different images for different devices or screen sizes. It enables art direction, where you serve entirely different images depending on the context, not just resized versions of the same image.

This is especially useful when different crops or compositions are better suited to different screen sizes — for example, a wide landscape on desktop and a centered square on mobile.

```html
<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 1024px)" srcset="/images/hero-desktop.jpg" />
  <source media="(min-width: 431px)" srcset="/images/hero-tablet.jpg" />
  <img src="/images/hero-mobile.jpg" alt="Scenic view of mountains and river" />
</picture>
```

## Limitations of Next.js Image Component

The built-in Next.js `<Image>` component doesn’t support the `<picture>` element. It's optimized for responsive image sizing via srcSet and sizes, but it doesn't allow for art direction — you can't define separate images for different breakpoints or aspect ratios. You're limited to automatic resizing of a single source image.

If you need art direction or want to use `<source>` elements directly, you'll need a different approach — which is where **next-image-plus** comes in.

## Next Image Plus

**next-image-plus** is a set of primitive React components, built on top of the <Link href="https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image">Next.js Image API</Link> and <Link href="https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19">React 19</Link>, which adds support for picture and background images.

### Install the package

First we need to install <Link href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-image-plus">next-image-plus</Link> package from npm:

```shell
npm install next-image-plus
```

### Using the Picture, Source, and Img components

**next-image-plus** provides 3 components for creating responsive images with art direction:

- `<Picture>` component provides a wrapper for zero or more Source components and one Img component.
- `<Source>` component specifies an image and a media query.
- `<Img>` component provides a fallback image

To set up the `Picture` component, we'll need to import the following inside our Next.js component:

```tsx
import { Picture, Source, Img } from "next-image-plus";
```

The <Link href="https://web.dev/learn/design/picture-element">HTML picture element</Link> allows for multiple source images, for our demo here, we're going to use 3 different sized images: medium, large, and a fallback.

| Breakpoint | Image                               | Media                                      | Width | Height |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----- | ------ |
| medium     | https://picsum.photos/id/59/860/430 | (min-width: 431px) and (max-width: 1023px) | 860px | 430px  |
| large      | https://picsum.photos/id/59/220/220 | (min-width: 1024px)                        | 220px | 220px  |
| fallback   | https://picsum.photos/id/59/430/215 | (max-width: 430px)                         | 430px | 215px  |

Using the components, we can create a `picture` element with 2 sources and a fallback image.

```tsx
<Picture>
  {/* Medium */}
  <Source
    media="(min-width: 431px) and (max-width: 1023px)"
    src="https://picsum.photos/id/59/860/430"
    width={860}
    height={430}
  />
  {/* Large */}
  <Source
    media="(min-width: 1024px)"
    src="https://picsum.photos/id/59/220/220"
    width={220}
    height={220}
  />
  {/* Fallback */}
  <Img
    src="https://picsum.photos/id/59/430/215"
    width={430}
    height={215}
    alt="Mountains and a river"
  />
</Picture>
```

In the browser, this will render the following HTML:

```html
<html>
  <picture>
    <source
      media="(min-width: 431px) and (max-width: 1023px)"
      width="860"
      height="430"
      srcset="
        /_next/image?url=https://picsum.photos/id/59/860/430&w=860&q=75  1x,
        /_next/image?url=https://picsum.photos/id/59/860/430&w=1920&q=75 2x
      "
    />
    <source
      media="(min-width: 1024px)"
      width="220"
      height="220"
      srcset="
        /_next/image?url=https://picsum.photos/id/59/220/220&w=256&q=75 1x,
        /_next/image?url=https://picsum.photos/id/59/220/220&w=640&q=75 2x
      "
    />
    <img
      src="/_next/image?url=https://picsum.photos/id/59/430/215&w=860&q=75"
      width="430"
      height="215"
      alt="Mountains and a river"
    />
  </picture>
</html>
```

<Callout type="info">
A key difference between the native html element for `<source>` and the `<Source>` component, is the html element does not accept a `src` attribute, but uses `srcset` instead.

The value for `srcset` will get automatically generated for you, using the Next.js Image API, based on the `src` prop value.

</Callout>

### Preloading

If your image is flagged as the <Link href="https://web.dev/articles/lcp#what-elements-are-considered">Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</Link>, preloading can improve your web core vitals score. The `<Picture>` component
has built-in support for preloading images.

```tsx
<Picture preload={true} fallbackMedia="(max-width: 430px)">
```

In the browser, this will render the following HTML:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <link
      rel="preload"
      as="image"
      fetchpriority="high"
      imagesrcset="/_next/image?url=https://picsum.photos/id/59/430/215&w=430&q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https://picsum.photos/id/59/430/215&w=860&q=75 2x"
      media="(max-width: 430px)"
    />
    <link
      rel="preload"
      as="image"
      fetchpriority="high"
      imagesrcset="/_next/image?url=https://picsum.photos/id/59/860/430&w=860&q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https://picsum.photos/id/59/860/430&w=1920&q=75 2x"
      media="(min-width: 431px) and (max-width: 1023px)"
    />
    <link
      rel="preload"
      as="image"
      fetchpriority="high"
      imagesrcset="/_next/image?url=https://picsum.photos/id/59/220/220&w=256&q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https://picsum.photos/id/59/220/220&w=640&q=75 2x"
      media="(min-width: 1024px)"
    />
  </head>
</html>
```

<Callout type="important">
For preloading to work properly, media queries cannot overlap.

Media queries on `<link rel="preload">` elements do not function the way they do on HTML elements.
The user agent will look at multiple `<link rel="preload">` elements and find multiple matches if there is any overlap in the media queries.
This can lead to performance issues, where multiple images are preloaded.

To avoid this, the `<Picture />` component will automatically adjust the media queries set on Source to remove any overlap, by adding or subtracting 1 px.
If this functionality causes any issues, it can be disabled with the `normalizeMediaQueries` prop.

</Callout>

All together, the page template would look something like this:

```tsx
@filename: /app/page.tsx
import { Picture, Source, Img } from "next-image-plus";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="grid">
      <main className="flex flex-col gap-8">
        <Picture preload={true} fallbackMedia="(max-width: 430px)">
          {/* Medium */}
          <Source
            media="(min-width: 431px) and (max-width: 1023px)"
            src="https://picsum.photos/id/59/860/430"
            width={860}
            height={430}
          />
          {/* Large */}
          <Source
            media="(min-width: 1024px)"
            src="https://picsum.photos/id/59/220/220"
            width={220}
            height={220}
          />
          {/* Fallback */}
          <Img
            src="https://picsum.photos/id/59/430/215"
            width={430}
            height={215}
            alt="Mountains and a river"
          />
        </Picture>
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

This is obviously a very basic example, but I hope it demonstrates the power of the **next-image-plus** `<Picture />` component.
