Today, I'm excited to announce the release of Next Image Plus v1.

Here's what's changed since the first beta release:

- Migrated from <Link href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsup">tsup</Link> to <Link href="https://rollupjs.org/">rollup.js</Link>
- Improved test coverage
- Media queries are now normalized by default, with the option to disable
- Background image props `breakpoint` and `media` are now optional

---

## Media Queries Normalized by Default

If preloading was enabled, the beta version required a `fallbackMedia` value and manually setting media queries to avoid overlap:

### Before

```tsx
<Picture preload={true} fallbackMedia="(max-width: 430px)">
  {/* Medium breakpoint */}
  <Source media="(min-width: 431px) and (max-width: 1023px)" ... />
  {/* Large breakpoint */}
  <Source
    media="(min-width: 1024px)" ... />
  {/* Fallback */}
  <Img ... />
</Picture>
```

### After

```tsx
<Picture preload={true}>
  {/* Medium breakpoint */}
  <Source media="(min-width: 430px) and (max-width: 1024px)" ... />
  {/* Large breakpoint */}
  <Source
    media="(min-width: 1024px)" ... />
  {/* Fallback */}
  <Img ... />
</Picture>
```

The component will now automatically adjust media queries to prevent any overlap and also set a media query for fallback for preloading links. The above code will
generate the following:

```html
<head>
  <link rel="preload" as="image" ... media="(max-width: 430px)" />
  <link
    rel="preload"
    as="image"
    ...
    media="(min-width: 431px) and (max-width: 1023px)"
  />
  <link rel="preload" as="image" ... media="(min-width: 1024px)" />
</head>
```

This behavior can be disabled by setting `normalizeMediaQueries` to `false` and then providing a `fallbackMedia` value.

## Background Image Improvements

Background image props `breakpoint` and `media` are now optional. Previous beta versions required setting these props, even for single images, which made the component awkward to use:

### Before

```tsx
<BackgroundImage
  id="examples__background-image"
  images={[
    {
      breakpoint="fallback"
      media="(min-width: 0px)"
      url: "https://picsum.photos/id/870/430/466",
      width: 430,
      height: 466,
    },
  ]}
>
```

### After

```tsx
<BackgroundImage
  id="examples__background-image"
  images={[
    {
      url: "https://picsum.photos/id/870/430/466",
      width: 430,
      height: 466,
    },
  ]}
>
```
