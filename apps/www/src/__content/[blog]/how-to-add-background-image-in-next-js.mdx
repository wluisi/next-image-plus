## Introduction

This guide will show you how to add a background image to a HTML element in your Next.js app.

A background image is a decorative image placed behind other content within an HTML element. This is typically done using CSS's `background-image` property.

```css
background-image: url("/images/background.jpg");
```

## Next.js Image Component

The Next.js `<Image />` component renders a single `<img>` element, which unfortunately cannot support adding a background image via CSS styles to another element.

With the release of `v14.1.0`, Next.js added a new function called `getImageProps()`.

This function exposes some of the under the hood Image API and allows you to get props to pass to an HTML `<img>` element.
The problem with using this function for background images is that you cannot preload the image, as setting `priority` to `true` has no effect, and does not add `<link rel="preload" as="image">` tag to the document's `<head>`.

## Next Image Plus

**next-image-plus** is a set of primitive React components, built on top of the <Link href="https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image">Next.js Image API</Link> and <Link href="https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19">React 19</Link>, which adds full support for picture and background images, including preloading for images flagged as the LCP.

### Install the package

First we need to install <Link href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-image-plus">next-image-plus</Link> package from npm:

```shell
npm install next-image-plus
```

### Using the BackgroundImage component

To use the `BackgroundImage` component, import it and set the id, className and images props:

```tsx
import { BackgroundImage } from "next-image-plus";

<BackgroundImage
  id="examples__background-image"
  className="absolute inset-0 bg-cover bg-center bg-no-repeat"
  images={[
    {
      url: "https://picsum.photos/id/502/2560/800",
      width: 2560,
      height: 800,
    },
  ]}
/>;
```

Under the hood the component will handle rendering the HTML markup, as well as applying the necessary CSS styles to set the background image.

Render the HTML markup with your id and class name:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```html
<div id="examples__background-image" class="absolute inset-0 bg-cover bg-center bg-no-repeat"></div>
```

Add a `<style>` tag to the document `<head>` that generates the css for your background image:

```html
<style data-href="examples__background-image" data-precedence="high">
  #examples__background-image {
    background-image: url(/_next/image?url=https://picsum.photos/id/502/2560/800&w=3840&q=75);
  }
</style>
```

The `<BackgroundImage />` component is not limited to just `<div>` elements, but can be configured to render any HTML element, using the `as` prop.

```tsx
import { BackgroundImage } from "next-image-plus";

<BackgroundImage
  id="examples__background-image"
  className="absolute inset-0 bg-cover bg-center bg-no-repeat"
  images={[
    {
      url: "https://picsum.photos/id/502/2560/800",
      width: 2560,
      height: 800,
    },
  ]}
  as="span"
/>;
```

This will render the following HTML:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```html
<span id="examples__background-image" class="absolute inset-0 bg-cover bg-center bg-no-repeat"></span>
```

### Preloading for LCP

If your `<BackgroundImage />` component is above the fold, or flagged as the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), it should be preloaded to improve performance.

Setting the `preload` prop to `true` will automatically handle this for you:

```tsx
import { BackgroundImage } from "next-image-plus";

<BackgroundImage
  id="examples__background-image-preload"
  className="absolute inset-0 bg-cover bg-center bg-no-repeat"
  images={[
    {
      url: "https://picsum.photos/id/502/2560/800",
      width: 2560,
      height: 800,
    },
  ]}
  preload={true}
/>;
```

When `preload` is set to true, the component will add a `<link rel="preload" as="image">` tag to the document's `<head>`

```html
<head>
  <link
    rel="preload"
    as="image"
    fetchpriority="high"
    imagesrcset="/_next/image?url=https://picsum.photos/id/502/2560/800&w=3840&q=75 1x"
  />
</head>
```

This tells the browser that this image is a critical resource, which should be fetched as soon as possible. You can read more about preloading <Link href="https://web.dev/articles/preload-responsive-images#preload">here</Link>
