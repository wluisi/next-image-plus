### src

The URL of the image source. The value must a path string or a statically imported file.

```ts
src = "/image.jpg"
```

### alt

The alt text for the image.

```ts
alt = "Mountains and a river"
```

### width

The width prop functions the same way as it does on the Next.js `<Image />` component.

```ts
width = {500}
```

> _The width property represents the intrinsic image width in pixels._
> _This property is used to infer the correct aspect ratio of the image and avoid layout shift during loading._
> _It does not determine the rendered size of the image,_
> _which is controlled by CSS, similar to the width attribute in the HTML `<img>` tag._
