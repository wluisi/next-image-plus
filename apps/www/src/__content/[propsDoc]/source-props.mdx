### src

The URL of the image source. The value must be a path string or a statically imported file.

```ts
src = "/image.jpg"
```

<Callout type='info'>
A key difference between the native html element for `<source>` and the `<Source />` component, is the html element does not accept a `src` attribute,
but uses `srcset` instead.

The value for `srcset` will get automatically generated for you, using the Next.js Image API, based on the `src` prop value.
</Callout>

### media

A media query string, defining when to use this particular source image.

```ts
media = "(max-width: 430px)"
```

### width

The width prop functions the same way as it does on the Next.js `<Image />` component.

```ts
width = {500}
```

> _The width property represents the intrinsic image width in pixels._
> _This property is used to infer the correct aspect ratio of the image and avoid layout shift during loading._
> _It does not determine the rendered size of the image,_
> _which is controlled by CSS, similar to the width attribute in the HTML `<img>` tag._
