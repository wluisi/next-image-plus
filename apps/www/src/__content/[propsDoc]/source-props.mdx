### src

The URL of the image source. The value must be a path string or a statically imported file.

```ts
<Source src="/image.jpg" />
```

### width

The width prop functions the same way as it does on the Next.js `<Image />` component.

> _The width property represents the intrinsic image width in pixels._
> _This property is used to infer the correct aspect ratio of the image and avoid layout shift during loading._
> _It does not determine the rendered size of the image,_
> _which is controlled by CSS, similar to the width attribute in the HTML `<img>` tag._
