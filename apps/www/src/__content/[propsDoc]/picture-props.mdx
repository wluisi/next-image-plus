### preload

Optional prop for preloading the image. This works similar to the `priority` prop on the Next.js Image component.
Should be used for any `<Picture />` component that is above the fold, and flagged as the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).

```ts
preload={false}
```

<Callout type='important'>
For preloading to work properly, media queries on `<link rel="preload">` elements cannot overlap.
Media queries on `<link rel="preload">` elements do not function the way they do on HTML elements.
The user agent will look at multiple `<link rel="preload">` media queries and find multiple matches if there is any overlap in the media queries.
This can lead to performance issues, where multiple images are preloaded.
To avoid this, the `<Picture />` component will automatically adjust the media queries set on Source to remove any overlap,
by adding or subtracting 1 px. If this functionality causes any issues, it can be disabled with the `normalizeMediaQueries` prop.
</Callout>

### fallbackMedia

An optional prop, to set the fallback media query for preloading.

```ts
fallbackMedia = "(max-width: 430px)";
```

### normalizeMediaQueries

An optional prop to disable the component from normalizing the media queries to remove overlap.

```ts
normalizeMediaQueries={false}
```

### children

Optional child elements to render inside the component.

```ts
<Picture>
  <Source srcSet="image-320w.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px)" />
  <Img src="image.jpg" alt="Example image" />
</Picture>
```
