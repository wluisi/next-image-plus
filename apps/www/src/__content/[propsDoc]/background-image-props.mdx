### id

A unique id for the background image html element.

```ts
id = "examples__background-image";
```

### as

The HTML tag or React component to use as the wrapper. Defaults to `<div>`.

```ts
as = "span";
```

### preload

Optional prop for preloading the background image. This works similar to the `priority` prop on the Next.js image.
Should be used for any `<BackgroundImage />` component that is above the fold, and flagged as the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).

```ts
preload={false} // {false} | {true}
```

<Callout type='important'>
For preloading to work properly, media queries on `<link rel="preload">` elements cannot overlap.
Media queries on `<link rel="preload">` elements do not function the way they do on HTML elements.
The user agent will look at multiple `<link rel="preload">` media queries and find multiple matches if there is any overlap in the media queries.
This can lead to performance issues, where multiple images are preloaded.

To avoid this, the `<BackgroundImage />` component will automatically adjust the media queries set on the preload links, by adding or subtracting 1 px.
If this functionality causes any issues, it can be disabled with the `normalizeMediaQueries` prop.

</Callout>

### images

An array of image objects of the `BackgroundImageOptions` type.

```ts
images={[ ... ]}
```

### className

Optional prop for any CSS class name(s) for the background image element.

```ts
className = "absolute inset-0 bg-cover bg-center bg-no-repeat";
```

### style

Optional prop for any CSS style properties for the background image element.

```ts
style={{ color: "red" }}
```

### children

Optional child elements to render inside the component.

### normalizeMediaQueries

Optional prop to disable the component from normalizing the media queries to remove overlaps. Defaults to `true`

```ts
normalizeMediaQueries={false} // {false} | {true}
```
