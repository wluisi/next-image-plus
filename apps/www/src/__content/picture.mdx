# Picture Component

## Overview

The **next-image-plus** `<Picture>` is a React component extends the HTML `<picture>` element to provide features for automatic image optimization,
using the power of the Next.js Image API.

- item 1
- item 2
- item 3
- item 4

**next-image-plus** provides 3 components for creating responsive images with art direction:

- `<Picture>` component provides a wrapper for zero or more Source components and one Image component.
- `<Source>` component specifies an image and a media query.
- `<Img>` component provides a fallback image

A **responsive image** loads different sizes of the same image. The next.js Image component handles this already.

**Art direction** shows different images for different display sizes, and takes it a step further, by loading completely different images depending on the display.

The **next-image-plus** Picture component allows developers to provide multple different images for different display sizes.

The browser uses the first Source component with a media query that returns true.
If none of the media queries match, the browser falls back to loading the image specified by the Image component

```tsx
import { Picture, Source, Image } from "next-image-extras";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Picture>
      <Source
        src="/images/medium.jpg"
        width={400}
        height={200}
        media="(min-width: 600px) and (max-width:959px)"
      />
      <Source
        src="/images/large.jpg"
        width={600}
        height={600}
        media="(min-width: 960px)"
      />
      <Image
        src="/images/fallback.jpg"
        width={600}
        height={600}
        alt="Mountains and a river"
      />
    </Picture>
  );
}
```

## Picture Props

| Prop          | Example                              | Type    | Status |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------- | ------ |
| preload       | `preload={true}`                     | Boolean | -      |
| fallbackMedia | `fallbackMedia="(max-width: 430px)"` | String  | -      |

### preload

```ts
priority={false} // {false} | {true}
```

Optional prop for preloading the image. This works similar to the `priority` prop on the Next.js image.
Should be used for any `<Picture>` component that is flagged as the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).
All images inside picture are lazy loaded by default, but preload should be used for any image above the fold.

[todo add more here]

### fallbackMedia

## Source Props

| Prop   | Example                                  | Type         | Status   |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| src    | `src="/image.jpg"`                       | String       | Required |
| media  | `media="(max-width: 430px)"`             | String       | Required |
| width  | `width={500}`                            | Integer (px) | Required |
| height | `height={500}`                           | Integer (px) | Required |
| sizes  | `sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 33vw"` | String       | -        |

### src

The value must a path string or a statically imported file.

```ts
// Path string example
<Source src="/image.jpg" />

// Static import example
import myImage from './image.jpg'

<Source src={myImage} />
```

> A key difference between the native html element for `<source>` and the `<Source>` component, is the html element does not accept a `src` attribute, but uses `srcset` instead.
>
> The value for `srcset` will get automatically generated for you, using the Next.js Image API, based on the `src` prop value.

### media

A media query string, defining when to use this particular source image.

### width

The width prop functions the same way as it does on the Next.js `<Image>` component:

> _The width property represents the intrinsic image width in pixels. This property is used to infer the correct aspect ratio of the image and avoid layout shift during loading.
> It does not determine the rendered size of the image, which is controlled by CSS, similar to the width attribute in the HTML `<img>` tag._
>

### height

The height prop functions the same way as it does on the Next.js `<Image>` component:

> _The height property represents the intrinsic image height in pixels. This property is used to infer the correct aspect ratio of the image and avoid layout shift during loading.
> It does not determine the rendered size of the image, which is controlled by CSS, similar to the height attribute in the HTML `<img>` tag._
