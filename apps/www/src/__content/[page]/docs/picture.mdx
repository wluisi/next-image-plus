# Picture Component

## Overview

The **next-image-plus** `<Picture />` component is a primitive React component that extends the HTML `<picture>` element to provide features for automatic image optimization,
using the power of the Next.js Image API and React 19.

**next-image-plus** provides 3 components for creating responsive images with art direction:

- `<Picture />` component provides a wrapper for zero or more Source components and one Img component.
- `<Source />` component specifies an image and a media query.
- `<Img />` component provides a fallback image

A **responsive image** loads different sizes of the same image. The Next.js Image component handles this already.

A responsive image with **Art Direction**, will show different images for different display sizes, and takes it a step further, by loading completely different images depending on the display.

The **next-image-plus** `<Picture />` component allows developers to provide multiple different images for different display sizes.

The browser uses the first `<Source />` component with a media query that returns true. If none of the media queries match, the browser falls back to loading the image specified by the `<Img />` component.

Basic example:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```tsx
import { Picture, Source, Img } from "next-image-plus";

<Picture preload={true}>
  <Source
    media="(min-width: 430px) and (max-width: 1024px)"
    src="/images/medium.jpg"
    width={860}
    height={430}
  />
  <Source
    media="(min-width: 1024px)"
    src="/images/large.jpg"
    width={220}
    height={220}
  />
  <Img
    src="/images/fallback.jpg"
    width={430}
    height={215}
    alt="mountains and a river"
  />
</Picture>
```

## Picture Props

| Prop                  | Example                              | Type    | Status |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------- | ------ |
| preload               | `preload={true}`                     | Boolean | -      |
| fallbackMedia         | `fallbackMedia="(max-width: 430px)"` | String  | -      |
| normalizeMediaQueries | `normalizeMediaQueries={true}`       | Boolean | -      |

### preload

```ts
preload={false} // {false} | {true}
```

Optional prop for preloading the image. This works similar to the `priority` prop on the Next.js Image component.
Should be used for any `<Picture />` component that is above the fold, and flagged as the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).

<Callout type="important">
For preloading to work properly, media queries on `<link rel="preload">` elements cannot overlap.

Media queries on `<link rel="preload">` elements do not function the way they do on HTML elements.
The user agent will look at multiple `<link rel="preload">` media queries and find multiple matches if there is any overlap in the media queries.
This can lead to performance issues, where multiple images are preloaded.

To avoid this, the `<Picture />` component will automatically adjust the media queries set on Source to remove any overlap, by adding or subtracting 1 px.
If this functionality causes any issues, it can be disabled with the `normalizeMediaQueries` prop.

</Callout>

### fallbackMedia

An optional prop, to set the fallback media query for preloading.

### normalizeMediaQueries

```ts
normalizeMediaQueries={false} // {false} | {true}
```

An optional prop to disable the component from normalizeing the media queries to remove overlap.

## Source Props

| Prop   | Example                                  | Type         | Status   |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| src    | `src="/image.jpg"`                       | String       | Required |
| media  | `media="(max-width: 430px)"`             | String       | Required |
| width  | `width={500}`                            | Integer (px) | Required |
| height | `height={500}`                           | Integer (px) | Required |
| sizes  | `sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 33vw"` | String       | -        |

### src

The value must a path string or a statically imported file.

```ts
// Path string example.
<Source src="/image.jpg" />

// Static import example.
import myImage from "./image.jpg"

<Source src={myImage} />
```

<Callout type="info">
A key difference between the native html element for `<source>` and the `<Source />` component, is the html element does not accept a `src` attribute, but uses `srcset` instead.

The value for `srcset` will get automatically generated for you, using the Next.js Image API, based on the `src` prop value.

</Callout>

### media

A media query string, defining when to use this particular source image.

### width

The width prop functions the same way as it does on the Next.js `<Image />` component:

> _The width property represents the intrinsic image width in pixels. This property is used to infer the correct aspect ratio of the image and avoid layout shift during loading.
> It does not determine the rendered size of the image, which is controlled by CSS, similar to the width attribute in the HTML `<img>` tag._

### height

The height prop functions the same way as it does on the Next.js `<Image />` component:

> _The height property represents the intrinsic image height in pixels. This property is used to infer the correct aspect ratio of the image and avoid layout shift during loading.
> It does not determine the rendered size of the image, which is controlled by CSS, similar to the height attribute in the HTML `<img>` tag._

| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------ | -------- |
