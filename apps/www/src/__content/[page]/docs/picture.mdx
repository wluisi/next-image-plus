# Picture Component

## Overview

The **next-image-plus** `<Picture>` component is a primitive React component that extends the HTML `<picture>` element to provide features for automatic image optimization,
using the power of the Next.js Image API and React 19.

**next-image-plus** provides 3 components for creating responsive images with art direction:

- `<Picture>` component provides a wrapper for zero or more Source components and one Img component.
- `<Source>` component specifies an image and a media query.
- `<Img>` component provides a fallback image

A **responsive image** loads different sizes of the same image. The Next.js Image component handles this already.

A responsive image with **Art Direction**, will show different images for different display sizes, and takes it a step further, by loading completely different images depending on the display.

The **next-image-plus** `<Picture>` component allows developers to provide multiple different images for different display sizes.

The browser uses the first `<Source>` component with a media query that returns true. If none of the media queries match, the browser falls back to loading the image specified by the `<Img>` component.

Basic example:

```tsx
import { Picture, Source, Img } from "next-image-plus";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Picture preload={true} fallbackMedia="(max-width: 430px)">
      <Source
        media="(min-width: 431px) and (max-width: 1023px)"
        src="/images/medium.jpg"
        width={860}
        height={430}
      />
      <Source
        media="(min-width: 1024px)"
        src="/images/large.jpg"
        width={220}
        height={220}
      />
      <Img
        src="/images/fallback.jpg"
        width={430}
        height={215}
        alt="mountains"
      />
    </Picture>
  );
}
```

## Picture Props

| Prop          | Example                              | Type    | Status |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------- | ------ |
| preload       | `preload={true}`                     | Boolean | -      |
| fallbackMedia | `fallbackMedia="(max-width: 430px)"` | String  | -      |

### preload

```ts
preload={false} // {false} | {true}
```

Optional prop for preloading the image. This works similar to the `priority` prop on the Next.js image.
Should be used for any `<Picture>` component that is above the fold, and flagged as the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).

<Callout type="important">
Media queries on `<link rel="preload">` do not function the way they do on HTML elements.
The user agent will look at multiple `<link rel="preload">` elements and find multiple matches if there is any overlap in the media queries.
This can lead to performance issues, where multiple images are preloaded, so when setting media queries, make sure each one targets a unique range.

For preloading to work properly, media queries cannot overlap. This is not a limitation of the component per se, but how browser's parse `<link rel="preload">` elements in `<head>`.

i.e, for your medium breakpoint, if your fallback is `max-width: 430px`

- _don't do this_ ~~`(min-width: 430px) and (max-width: 1023px)`~~
- **do this** `(min-width: 431px) and (max-width: 1023px)`

</Callout>

### fallbackMedia

An optional prop, to set the fallback media query for preloading.

## Source Props

| Prop   | Example                                  | Type         | Status   |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| src    | `src="/image.jpg"`                       | String       | Required |
| media  | `media="(max-width: 430px)"`             | String       | Required |
| width  | `width={500}`                            | Integer (px) | Required |
| height | `height={500}`                           | Integer (px) | Required |
| sizes  | `sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 33vw"` | String       | -        |

### src

The value must a path string or a statically imported file.

```ts
// Path string example.
<Source src="/image.jpg" />

// Static import example.
import myImage from "./image.jpg"

<Source src={myImage} />
```

<Callout type="info">
A key difference between the native html element for `<source>` and the `<Source>` component, is the html element does not accept a `src` attribute, but uses `srcset` instead.

The value for `srcset` will get automatically generated for you, using the Next.js Image API, based on the `src` prop value.

</Callout>

### media

A media query string, defining when to use this particular source image.

### width

The width prop functions the same way as it does on the Next.js `<Image>` component:

> _The width property represents the intrinsic image width in pixels. This property is used to infer the correct aspect ratio of the image and avoid layout shift during loading.
> It does not determine the rendered size of the image, which is controlled by CSS, similar to the width attribute in the HTML `<img>` tag._

### height

The height prop functions the same way as it does on the Next.js `<Image>` component:

> _The height property represents the intrinsic image height in pixels. This property is used to infer the correct aspect ratio of the image and avoid layout shift during loading.
> It does not determine the rendered size of the image, which is controlled by CSS, similar to the height attribute in the HTML `<img>` tag._

### sizes

The sizes prop functions the same way as it does on the Next.js `<Image>` component:

## Img Props

| Prop   | Example                 | Type         | Status   |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| src    | `src="/image.jpg"`      | String       | Required |
| width  | `width={500}`           | Integer (px) | Required |
| height | `height={500}`          | Integer (px) | Required |
| alt    | `mountains and a river` | String       | -        |

### src

The value must a path string or a statically imported file.
